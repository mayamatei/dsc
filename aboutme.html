    <h2>Background Information</h2>
    <p>Originally from Slovakia, I made the bold decision to move to Denmark to pursue my studies in Financial Management. At just 24 years old, I bring a fresh perspective and a fervent enthusiasm to the world of finance.</p>
    <p>During my academic journey, I had the incredible opportunity to undertake an internship at HB Reavis, a prominent company in working in commercial real estsate development. This experience served as a pivotal moment in my professional development, allowing me to gain practical insights and hands-on experience in the real-world application of financial management concepts.</p>
    <p>This hands-on experience sharpened my analytical skills and expanded my knowledge of financial tools and techniques. I also had the opportunity to observe how financial decisions are made, considering factors such as risk assessment, market trends, and long-term sustainability.</p>
